# Some gathered utilities

This repo is a collection of utilities that otherwise were being copied around all the time. Most remarkable utilities right now are:

* BindingAdapter with some convenience subclasses for RecyclerView adapters that use DataBinding
* PaginatedBindingAdapters that combines previous, and also gives RxJava2 pagination support

##### `adapters` is top level package (this should be the only include)
